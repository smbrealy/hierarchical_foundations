foundation_modelv5 loads the FE derived data and creates surrogate models. It then runs the Bayesian hierarchical model (the .stan file) to generate the results seen in the paper "Anomaly Detection in Offshore Wind Turbine Structures using Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling"

lvv_results plots some of the data from the experimental results.
